## Project: k-File ⇄ BRL‑CAD Converters - Andrea Braghin

This repository hosts weekly progress reports for the Google Summer of Code 2025 project **Improving the k-File to BRL‑CAD Converter & proposal for BRL‑CAD database to k-File converter**.

 **Project Summary:**
> This project is intended to improve the interoperability between LS‑DYNA and BRL‑CAD by enhancing the existing **k → g** converter and by implementing a new **g → k** converter. The primary goal is to facilitate a seamless data exchange between LS‑DYNA keyword files and BRL‑CAD geometry databases, ultimately streamlining workflows for users who need to transition between simulation and geometric modeling.
