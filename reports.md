## Daily reports and project update

# Day One: June 2nd - May the coding begin! ðŸ’ª
 ### Achievements:

 - Literature review - [LS-DYNA Keyword manual](https://ftp.lstc.com/anonymous/outgoing/web/ls-dyna_manuals/R15/LS-DYNA_Manual_Volume_I_R15.pdf) - selection of geometry-related features to be implemented.
 - *Element_Discrete_Sphere implementation in k_parser.h and k_parser.cpp, to be tested.
 - *Element_Seatbelt implementation testing on [THUMS model](https://www.toyota.co.jp/thums/).
  
### Issues:
  *Element_Seatbelt can be use for different purposes, it can represent a muscle ligament for example. Its geometrical properties can still be tuned and drawn with no additional requirement. For something like *Element_Seatbelt_Slipring, however, further analysis has to be carried on about its possible multipurpose applications between 2 Element_Seatbelts because its geometry may depend on the application.
