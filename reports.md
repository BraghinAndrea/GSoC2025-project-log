## Daily reports and project update

# Day One: June 2nd - May the coding begin! ðŸ’ª
 ### Achievements:

 - Literature review - [LS-DYNA Keyword manual](https://ftp.lstc.com/anonymous/outgoing/web/ls-dyna_manuals/R15/LS-DYNA_Manual_Volume_I_R15.pdf) - selection of geometry-related features to be implemented.
 - *Element_Discrete_Sphere implementation in k_parser.h and k_parser.cpp, to be tested.
 - *Element_Seatbelt implementation testing on [THUMS model](https://www.toyota.co.jp/thums/).
  
### Issues:
  *Element_Seatbelt can be use for different purposes, it can represent a muscle ligament for example. Its geometrical properties can still be tuned and drawn with no additional requirement. For something like *Element_Seatbelt_Slipring, however, further analysis has to be carried on about its possible multipurpose applications between 2 Element_Seatbelts because its geometry may depend on the application.
  
# June 3rd:
### Achievements:
Further testing on *Element_Seatbelt on various keyword files. 
By creating a 3-point seatbelt in LS-PrePost significant findings arised: the software allows the user to chose two different ways for creating a seatbelt part. A simpler "string", let's say 1D, version an a so-called "mixed" 2D version with a higher number of customizable features and dimensions.
A single seatbelt part contains multiple arbs, each is linked to specific nodes so the overall shape of the part is easily obtainable.

1D seatbelt conversion is partially successfull and drawn in mged, substantial code refinments are still needed:

### Issues:
Above-mentioned muscle ligaments appear to be 1D seatbelt parts with null thickness, it is necessary to discern the two during conversion. Code still needs substantial editing and revision.

# June 4th:
### Achievements:
Improvements in k-g.cpp . Seatbelt geometry gets now written in BRL-CAD database following LS-PrePost coordinate system. Nodes coordinates are used as reference points for arbs elements.

### Issues:
Dimensions of the seatbelt might need to be adjusted by tuning the scalar factor. In some cases it might be necessary to use shell elements following [LS-DYNA Keyword manual](https://ftp.lstc.com/anonymous/outgoing/web/ls-dyna_manuals/R15/LS-DYNA_Manual_Volume_I_R15.pdf) .

# June 5th:
### Achievements:
Worked on k-g.cpp, kparser.cpp and kparser.h for *Element_Seatbelt and *Section_Seatbelt.
### Issues:
Seatbelt loop is currently outside the main converter loop. Better access to Kdata is needed, a common iterator has to be found.

# June 6th:
### Achievements:
Finalizing first implementation for *Element_Seatbelt and *Section_Seatbelt. Opened a [Pull request](https://github.com/BRL-CAD/brlcad/pull/189#issue-3124559994)
### Issues:
Code might benefit from further improvements upon potential mentors' feedbacks.
